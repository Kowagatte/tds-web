__topdownshooter__ (name is WIP) is a retro-style video game designed to look like
it is played on an old arcade cabinet. The goal of the game is to collect all 6 coins on the map, the challenge? you are competing against another player in an arena. And of course, you have a portal gun.

## Goal
I want to get a working version of this project up and running in 2 weeks from
Mar. 3, 2022.

So the goal date is Mar. 17, 2022
